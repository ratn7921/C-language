# 🖥️ C Language – DSA & Algorithm Practice

Welcome to my **C Programming Practice Repository**!
This repo is a collection of my personal coding journey in **C language**, where I’ve practiced **Data Structures, Algorithms, and Logical Problem-Solving**.

The repository is organized into **3 main folders**, each representing different areas of my practice:

1. **DSA Implementations** – Classic data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
2. **Algorithms** – Sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, backtracking, etc.
3. **Logical & Problem-Solving Codes** – Small but powerful programs focusing on logic building, puzzles, and interview-style problems.

## 🚀 Why This Repository?

* 📌 **Hands-on Practice:** Every piece of code here is handwritten and practiced by me.
* 📌 **Strong Foundation:** Covers core concepts of **time complexity, memory management, and pointers** in C.
* 📌 **Industry-Ready:** Built with the mindset of **cracking coding interviews** and solving **real-world problems**.
* 📌 **Consistency:** Reflects my **dedication** to mastering problem-solving with a low-level programming language.
